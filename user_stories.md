# BUS MALL SHOPPING APP

## USER STORIES

### Developer
As the developer, I want to create an app with code that is clean (DRY) and returns the requested results. I wish to clearly meet the goals for each end-user, below. Because my initial design will form the basis of the final Bus Mall app branding, I will create graphics and use typography and color that are engaging, hip, and contemporary. The graphics must also create a desire for the user to shop. We will focus on the 20% of features that deliver the most value (see https://www.woodst.com/web-design-development/the-single-ui-design-best-practice-for-successful-websites-apps-systems/).

### End User: Marketing Research Team
As the developer, I will write code that provides data to the Marketing Research team in a way that allows ease of interpretation and dissemination. The results will provide clarity about the potential products: i.e. how many times a product is seen, what percentage of times the product is "approved" (clicked on), and total number of votes an item receives, and how many people are sampled in the focus groups.

### End User: Focus Groups
For the focus groups, we wish to design this research app in a way that is appealing and fun to a group of users for whom this app is totally new. The focus groups will be the first members of the public to get a feel for what the Bus Mall app might provide bus riders, and as such, must be visually engaging, easy to understand (how to use), and glitch-free.
